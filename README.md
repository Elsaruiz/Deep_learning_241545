First of all download the required requirements.txt in environment.
Then we have two ipynb notebooks:
- data_analysis: we analyze inside of data processed the training data properties 
- project: we have the rest of the model for it to work we will be needing of the files that are also on this repository: 
        - t5-sql-model: the model we are going to be finetuning
        - inside results plus having the photos of plots on the project we have the model we are going to generate with on experiment 4 exp_bs4_lr0.0001.
